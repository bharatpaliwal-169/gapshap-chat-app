# The Chat App : Ghapshap

This is a chat application build using react and socket.io for client-server communication.
This is a PWA Web application.

### LEARNINGS

#### React and Hooks -> useContext , useRef and customHook were some beautifully used hook all over the application.

#### Socket.io learned how we use socket.io for the client-server communication.
#### Deployment on heroku : deployment is never a easy task be it simple or complex application.

### Improvements needed
#### This application uses localstorage heavily and is less efficient in that perspective so will work on makeing it synchronous with DB.
#### Inclusion of images,videos,codes,and other media files in communication.
#### more defined structured server configuration and DB configuration.


Followed WebDevSimplified youtube channel for more information over the project.
